Climate-Smart Farming Workshops:
Elvekas Venture organized workshops for smallholder farmers, teaching climate-smart practices.
Farmers learned about drought-resistant crops, soil conservation, and efficient water management.
As a result, yields increased, and farmers became resilient in the face of changing weather patterns.
Tree Planting Campaigns:
The team rallied community members to plant thousands of trees.
These trees now provide shade, prevent soil erosion, and sequester carbon.
Schools joined in, integrating tree planting into their curriculum—creating a generation of eco-conscious students.
Women Empowerment:
Elvekas Venture recognized the vital role of women in agriculture.
They organized training sessions on sustainable farming techniques exclusively for women.
Women gained confidence, improved their families’ nutrition, and contributed to local food security.
Community Gardens:
Abandoned plots turned into lush community gardens.
Children and elders worked side by side, tending to vegetables and herbs.
The harvest not only fed families but also generated income through local markets.
Climate Champions in Schools:
Elvekas Venture partnered with schools, creating student-led climate clubs.
These young climate champions organized rallies, clean-up drives, and awareness campaigns.
Their enthusiasm spread beyond school walls, inspiring parents and neighbors.
Award-Winning Impact:
The Spirit award from the Youth Impact Challenge validated their efforts.
Elvekas Venture’s impact reached far beyond numbers—it touched hearts, changed mindsets, and sowed seeds of hope.
In the quiet villages of Nigeria, Elvekas Venture’s Climel Project has become a beacon of resilience, proving that collective action can heal our planet. 🌱🌍
